# Sweet Treats Ecommerce website

## Project Description

I wanted to test my React framework skills by building an ecommerce website using common hooks like useState, useEffect, and React router. I made sure that while the website can't take actual payment info, it can save the user's choice data using local storage.

## Project Challeges

There were struggles early on with the uni-directional flow of data and passing JS/hook data back and forth between components. This was also the first time I used elements like React router and local storage so it was a great project for learning new things.

## Project Lessons

After getting a basic understanding of lifting states to the parent method and data drilling through components, I was able to connect the functionality throughout my website fairly easily. I was also able to become much more comfortable with mapping arrays, arrow functions, ternary and spread operators.
